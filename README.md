# Data Structure & Algorithms

## 1. Learn Foundations:
- Learn the concepts, do not just skip to solving problems
- First learn fundamentals of data structures, then move to alogrithms
- Be able to implement core data structures & algorithms from scratch

## 2. Practice Problems:
- You cannot test run in interviews, so practice without running
- Aim for 2 to 3 problems a day, do the LeetCode Blind 75
- Try to solve problems within 30 mins
- If you can't solve it, look at the logic of solution
- Try it again for 30 mins, if you still can't solve then see code solution
- After successful submission take away a general pattern / lesson

## 3. Target State:
- Be able to solve medium level difficulty within 20 minutes
