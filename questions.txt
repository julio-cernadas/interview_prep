Big O Notation
	When discussing Big O notation, log always mean log base 2, 〖Log〗_2.
So, if you search for an element via a simple or brutal search of a list of 8 numbers, you would have to check 8 numbers -> O(n). But for a binary search it would be O(〖Log〗_n). So, log 8 == 3, because 2^3 == 8. For a list of 1024 elements, it would log 1024 = 10, because 2^10 == 1024.

- Hash map - we specify a key and a value linked to the key. The key is then hashed, and it is used as the index at which the value is stored in the table.
