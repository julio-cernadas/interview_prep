# Data Structure & Algorithms

## 1. Learn Foundations:
- Learn the concepts, do not just skip to solving problems
- First learn fundamentals of data structures, then move to alogrithms
- Be able to implement core data structures & algorithms from scratch

## 2. Practice Problems:
- You cannot test run in interviews, so practice without running
- Aim for 2 to 3 problems a day, do the LeetCode Blind 75
- Try to solve problems within 30 mins
- If you can't solve it, look at the logic of solution
- Try it again for 30 mins, if you still can't solve then see code solution

## 3. Target State:
- Be able to solve medium level difficulty within 20 minutes


Process:
1) solving the questions conceptually
2) writing down the concepts into the code
3) fine to look at the solution but need to understand what was the actual logic behind it
4) after successful submission take away a general pattern
