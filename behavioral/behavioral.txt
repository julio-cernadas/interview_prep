Leadership
Questions:
•	Tell me about a time you added value to a team or successfully led a team?
•	Describe a situation when you did much more than was expected from you on a project?
•	Describe a time when you exceeded expectations?
Visualize:
•	“If you want to go fast go alone, if you want to go far go together” – African Proverb
Background:
•	Strategy: lose battles & win the war.
•	Transform your war into a crusade: establish morale.
•	Decentralize tasks: divide & conquer.
•	Lead by example, lead from the front.
Implementation:
•	S: Final project for Python programming course. We were assigned random groups, and I was placed into a group of two gamers and one marketing student.
•	T: We had to make a fully functional command line application using Python skills. I wanted to build an options pricing model using web scraping. The team seemed uninterested and just wanted to get the work over with. I really liked the idea, but the group wasn’t into it. I knew that if I put my self-interests into the equation then I wouldn’t go far without their support.
•	A: After building rapport with each member, I knew exactly the type of project that would get them all engaged as I was. We would build a gaming application along the lines of flappy bird.
•	R:  The idea lit up the faces of the two gamers, and I proposed that the marketing student focus on the UX part since he had experience designing websites and advertisements. By proposing this project, I had created a sense of morale and started a crusade towards building a functional game. Each team member now thought less about themselves and more on the success of the group mission. I had landed on a manner that motivated all three team members towards working on the project, making it easier for me to delegate tasks and decentralize development. On top of this, I would stay in class every day for an extra half hour or so to work on the project; I was leading through action not just commands, this encouraged them to follow suit.

Question:
•	Describe a situation where you needed to persuade someone to see things your way?
•	Conflict with team or team member, in other words, how do you handle conflict.
Background:
•	No one wins in conflict! Negotiate the desired outcome.
•	Build rapport: practice tactical empathy to gain trust.
•	People want to be understood and accepted -> listen intensely to demonstrate empathy.
•	Negotiation isn’t a battle, it is an act of discovery -> uncover as much information as possible.
•	Strive for the “that’s right” moment: paraphrase and summarize the other sides concerns.
•	Anchor their emotions: set an extreme anchor to make your real compromise seem fair.
•	Prepare them for a loss -> loss aversion: let them see there’s something to lose by inaction.
•	Loss aversion: what happens if you do nothing?
•	Bring the other side’s desires back into the equation. Show that you care for their wants too.
Implementation:
•	S: NLP course final project on topic modeling for business, technology, and political news text. One student wasn’t contributing in any manner, this situation needed to be fixed.
•	T: Rest of group wanted to report his inaction to the professor. I told them that I would have a conversation with him to see if we could personally settle the problem or his situation.
•	A: I asked him to stay after class for a quick talk: I listened carefully to his viewpoints. I used labels like: “it seems like ____ is important.” or “it sounds like you are worried that _____”. I found out that he just wasn’t interested in category of data we were working with. I summarized his perspective to get the “that’s right” moment. Afterwards, I anchored his emotions by explaining that his inactivity would lead to a lower grade and incomplete project. I used loss aversion to make him visualize the group failing the project. Then I offered a solution.
•	R: I noticed he always wore sports clothing, so I suggested what if we switched the third topic to sports rather than politics. He was fascinated by the idea, and we spent the next few hours working on it together. I gave him a background on the models we built. We got an A.

Adaptability
Questions:
•	Explain a time when you didn't have all of the information needed to make a decision, and how you went about making it?
Visualize:
•	“In any moment of decision, the best thing you can do is the right thing, the next best thing is the wrong thing, and the worst thing you can do is nothing.” – Theodore Roosevelt
Background:
•	Accept the situation for what it is and take action.
•	Understand your risks and rewards, and have confidence in your final decision.
Implementation:
•	S: Managing your personal and parent’s portfolio during Q4 of 2018. US stock market had been booming for many months in a row, but now it had begun to make a significant correction / reversal. My dad’s financial advisor recommended re-allocating funds into other areas like gold or energy, but I believed that there was no running away from this market pivot.
•	T: Reduce downside risk of macro-index strategy based portfolio.
•	A: I used the information and resources that I was left with in an efficient manner. I conducted fundamental market research to fully understand the state the of global economy, reading the opinions of trustworthy resources. I proceeded to gathering societal sentiment by using my NLP machine-learning project for a glimpse into what the online sentiment about the market as a whole. I also used my industry-based topic modeling program to extract keywords from hundreds of articles online in a systematic manner. Finally, I asked people within my network whom are involved in finance as well, to get their perspectives and see the problem with an open mind. (Feedback is vital)
•	R: In order to not face the short-term capital gains tax by selling the position, I purchased derivative put options on the ETFs in our portfolio to provide a hedge against market turmoil. This acted as an insurance play to reduce risk; it came with a price but it was much better than risking the entire portfolio on the fall. We winded never exercising the puts and sold them off in December to cover almost all of our losses. A few months later the market recovered even better

Questions:
•	How do you handle a challenge?
•	Tell me about a time when you had to juggle several projects at the same time. How did you organize your time? What was the result?
•	Tell me about how you worked effectively under pressure. Describe a time when you faced a difficult situation and how you handled it.
•	Tell me about a time when you were asked to do something you had never done before. How did you react? What did you learn?
Visualize:
•	“By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.” – Benjamin Franklin
Background:
•	Observe the situation and tailor a solution so that you can navigate that scenario.
•	Write it down -> break the problem down into smaller parts -> observe the things you need to do and how they depend on other tasks -> categorize the problems -> design a plan.
o	This helps sort the problem for a successful solution.
o	By breaking the problem down, we make the challenge more manageable.
o	Ex: It’s like writing a book, you start by writing sentences to paragraphs then to chapters.
•	A degree of uncertainty will always remain, so be flexible in your methods but not your results. You may have to change your plan due to unforeseen circumstances.
•	There is always a way, your job is simply to find it and pursue it with all your will. Embrace change. In the midst of chaos, there is opportunity.
•	Lastly have fun. You can make an activity easier if you’re having fun, which eventually leads to confidence in the activity. One day I had plenty of work ahead of me overnight, rather than stressing out over it, I embraced the tough scenario and made a fun night out of working. I went to the convenience store, bought candy, snacks and energy drinks; finished everything on time.
Implementation:
•	S: Challenging scenario with lots of work coming up and deadline.
•	T: Deliver a finished and functional product.
•	A: Followed the skills mentioned above.
•	R: Successful execution.
Tell me about a time you added value to a team or successfully led a team?
•	S: BMGT313 final | STZ stock valuation project.
•	T: To build and present an effective stock pitch.
•	A: As the only member with Bloomberg terminal experience, I was able to find detailed information quickly, that my team would’ve had to otherwise search for on the internet or the SEC Edgar page.
•	R: Our professor considered our stock pitch the best presentation in the class, we had many screenshots of the research we performed with the help of the Bloomberg terminal.

Questions:
•	Tell me about the biggest change that you had to deal with. How did you adapt to that change?
•	What was the most controversial decision you've ever made?
•	Have you ever had any failure? What did you learn?
Implementation:
•	Moving from a finance focused to software development focused career.
•	Rather than fighting change in the industry, I chose to embrace it and pick up new skills needed to succeed through the transformation of finance.



Problem Solving
Questions:
•	Tell me about a time when you leveraged technology in school or work?
Implementation:
•	S: In the back-end development of Academy Trader, when retrieving security pricing from a market API, the API would set a time out when sending too many requests.
•	T: The task was to retrieve each security’s information without landing at an error.
•	A: Set up SQL reference-table to store historical details like industry, 52-week stats, earnings, dividend yield. Also set up a back-up pricing API via a try/except statement.
•	R: No more loading errors, problem solved.
When have you identified a problem along a process and enhanced it or came up with a way around it? Describe a time when you innovated.
•	S: Running a multinomial naive bayes supervised learning machine learning algorithm for text classification. Only achieved an 80% accuracy.
•	T: Raise the accuracy by applying other methods.
•	A: Developed a hybrid system of text classification with the help of NLTK lexicon based systems. ML algo labeled 1 or -1, lexicon system labeled the extent of positive or negative sentiment through a polarity score. They worked better in unison. Eliminated conflicting scores from data set.
•	R: Resulted in an accurate new classification system
