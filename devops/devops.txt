DevOps --------------------------------------------------------------
- Agile -> Focuses on timeliness
- DevOps ->
 	~ Continous Integration - typically developers work on features or stories within a sprint and commit their changes to a repo. Once code is comitted, their work is integrated and a build is performed to check for any errors or vulnerabilites.
	~ Continous Delivery - this is layer that revolves around getting the changes made by developers to the end-users as soon as possible. During this process, builds go through QA, Staging, and then to a PROD system.
 	~ Continous Testing
 	~ Continuous Monitoring
	~ Provides immediate feedback

- Needs for DevOps ->
	~ Reduce time between fixes/faster delivery
	~ Increase the frequency of development
	~ Prepare the crash rate of new product releases
	~ Lower the crash rate of new product releases

- Tools ->
	~ Jira - Planning
	~ Jenkins - Continous Integration
	~ Docker -
 	~ Puppet - configuration management used to automate system administration

- DevOps Phases ->
	~ Plan
	~ Code
	~ Developer
	~ Test
	~ Deploy
	~ Function

- How to approach a project ->
	~ Assessment of the current system (as-is) process. Identify any areas of improvement and provide a roadmap for the implementation
	~ A PoC can be done to showcase and end to end preview of a pipeline. Get feedback and finally begin to implement the system.
	~ Asure the projects follows all the continous principles.

- KPIs
 	~ Appliation performance
 	~ Availability
	~ Usage/Traffic
	~ Error rates
	~ Deployment time
