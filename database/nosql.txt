•	Difference Between Structured and Unstructured Data?
o	Structured data can be easily stored in SQL databases via values for rows and columns. It is highly organized information that uploads neatly into a relational database, they must have a relational key and can be easily mapped into fields.
o	Unstructured data may have its own internal structure but does not conform neatly into a spreadsheet or database. Most data are unstructured, but it is also where many key insights lay. A NoSQL database lends itself to unstructured data.
•	What are NoSQL databases?
o	They provide a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases.
	Types Include:
•	Document Oriented
•	Key Value
•	Why is it used?
o	Flexible data model in form of documents
o	Agile and highly scalable database
o	Faster than traditional databases due to efficient indexing and storage
•	What is MongoDB?
o	It stores data in a flexible, JSON-like document-oriented database which provides high performance, high availability and easy scalability. Instead of using tables and rows, it is made up of collections and documents.
•	What is Namespace in MongoDB?
o	The concatenation of the collection name and database name.
•	What is sharding in MongoDB?
o	The procedure of storing data records across multiple machines. It is like horizontal integration in business but instead horizontal partition, with each partition referred to as a shard.
•	What is a replica set?
o	A group of mongo instances that host the same data set.
o	One node is primary and another is secondary. From primary to secondary node all data replicates.
•	How replication works in MongoDB?
o	Across multiple servers, it is the process of synchronizing data. It helps in protecting the database from the loss of a single server.
•	How do you achieve a primary key – foreign key relationship?
o	MongoDB does not support primary key to foreign key relationships, but, you can achieve this concept by embedding one document inside another. Ex, an address document can be embedded inside a customer document.
•	Does MongoDB support foreign key constraints?
o	No.
